Using only primary participants, I looked at item Q129D, which asked how often the person’s partner “Kept [them] from having access to a job, money, or financial resources.”\nThe following table breaks down responses given by cis men and women, as the data for transgender people did not indicate a gender (“transgender”, the only option to analyse, is not a gender).\n\ntar_load(table)\n\ntable\n\nGenderPartner Prevents AccessNeverRarelySometimesOftenVery oftenNAFemale1,6544222853Male1,7014516417NA12632\n\n\nWe can see that the overwhelming majority of participants of both genders indicate never being subject to financial abuse.
